### Overview

graphql-gateway-java exposes data from various graph microservices using a single unified GraphQL schema. These microservices can be dynamically
registered with the Gateway using the `/register` endpoint. It uses [graphql orchestrator library](https://github.com/graph-quilt/graphql-orchestrator-java) for federating schemas from 
various data providers. 

Highlights:

* Dynamic registration so that the gateway is loosely coupled with the provider development lifecycle.
* Registering REST endpoints using the [@adapter](https://github.com/graph-quilt/graphql-service-adapters) directive and Service DSL
* Attribute Based Access Control using the [graphql-authorization-java](https://github.com/graph-quilt/graphql-authorization-java) library.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) 

### Running graphql-gateway-java locally

When running the application locally, [localstack](https://localstack.cloud/) is used to mock AWS S3.  Follow these steps to start the application.

1. Build the project:
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```

2. Run aws configure. Enter any value to the prompts presented. Since localstack is used, a real AWS credential is not needed, but make sure to input a valid region name (e.g. `us-west-1`) and output format (e.g. `json`).
    ```
    aws configure
    ```

3. Start Docker daemon if not already running.
    
4. Start the local registry. This starts a localstack docker container.
    ```
    ./local_registry/start.sh
    ```
  
5. Set up the local registry. This will initialize the registry with example service providers in `local_registry` folder.
    ```
    ./local_registry/setup.sh --empty-registry
    ```
    
6. Start the application. Once started, it listens on port 7000.

    ```
    ./run.sh
    ```
    OR 
   
    Run the class `GraphqlGatewayApplication` as Spring Application using IntelliJ. Set the active profile as **local**.

> **NOTE: You do not need to restart the application when you register a new provider service**.


### Test using GraphiQL

* Navigate to [http://localhost:7000/graphiql](http://localhost:7000/graphiql)
* We also have [example subgraphs](https://github.com/graph-quilt/example-subgraphs) with registration instructions for easy testing.
